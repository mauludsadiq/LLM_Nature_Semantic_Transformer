In this system, the transformer is not the authority on truth. It is a proposer of paths through a certified semantic universe. Each proposed path is executed deterministically, producing step digests that hash the pre-state, the operation, and the post-state. A verifier then replays the entire trace and confirms that every digest matches. If any step is inconsistent, the trace is rejected. The paragraph you are reading is the artifact: it passes through the proposer, executor, and verifier without wavering, because validity is enforced by replayable proof rather than probabilistic confidence.
